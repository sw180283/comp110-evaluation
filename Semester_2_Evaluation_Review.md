(b) Write a draft 500-word report that must:
i. identify three key skills that you consider weaknesses;
ii. assess your application of each of these skills, describing how they
affected the quality of your submissions and suggesting why they
became challenges;
iii. and then identify how to improve each of these skills, with reference
to SMART actions.

##Introduction
The three weakness that I found I could improve, during this semester was: more regular github commits, better use of referencing academic papers and more regular programming practise.

##Regular github commits
###Identify
During my projects, I have found that my Github commits are unevenly distributed with a few days on several commits each, then no commits for a week.

###Application, how they affected quality of submission, and why they became challenges
When working in a software career, it is crucial to regularly commit work to a group accessable project so that the team can all follow the development of the project and also offer support and suggestions for improvement. Also, this is needed for the individual to make sure that they are confident with their own work and not leaving gap during commits. It is suggestive that by not commiting Github regular that the code isn't being worked on. In my case this was true, in that I only worked on my programming in long bulk sessions isn't of regularly over a week in short sessions. This doesn't work for good programming practice and means that the workflow is poor and reducing my progessional practice mark. Another reason why this doesn't work for good practice is that by working long hours on one task can make the programmer lose focus and make mistakes. Instead I should have use short sessions to improve concentration and therefore produce higher quality code. I found that when I worked in shorter sessions, I figured our errors from the session before, the next day. Therefore, by sitting and working continuously didn't solve the issues.  

###To improve
To improve this skill I should time table regular expected days for commits and should schedule my programming sessions around this. If I expect myself to commit at least twice a week, then I should at least work on that project for two programming sessions. In addition, this will make sure that I have to go back to issues to see if they can be fixed on another day or take a break.

S - Make a schedule for expected Github commits each week  
M - Set 2 schedule deadlines for submitting code per week  
A - This is a reasonal amount of work when working around other assignments  
R - This is relevant to academic practice but also industry practice  
T - Each week I should see if I meet the deadlines for each commit  

##Better referencing of academic papers
###Identify
Another weakness I found while working on my essays was that I struggled with knowing what to include in each academic citation. In particular, I didn't know how to reference single pages of a paper or how to cite researches when named in-line.

###Application, how they affected quality of submission, and why they became challenges
When writing essays, it is crucial to properly cite papers used and to include the appropriate style of referencing. This affected my essay confidence and my mark for academic writing style and referencing, as there was inconstistencies and opportunities where references could have been more specific and clear as to which page and chapter the quote was taken. This became an issue because I couldn't find constistent methods of referencing on the internet, where there appeared to be lots of different ways to reference papers using the same style. Therefore, when using references, I typically used an auto citation method that provided the referencing in a style suitable to BibTex.

###To improve
To improve, I should ask which method is best to use when referencing, for a specific source if I am struggling. I should avoid using an inconsistent method of referencing sources and attempt to include all the relevant information. By improving this skill, I can improve my academic writing style and the quality of my referencing section for all my essays.

S - Make a referencing guild for a variety of source types  
M - Have a complete referencing guild  
A - This is a reasonal aim and shouldn't take long to make  
R - This is relevant to academic writing and research practice  
T - Next month, I should check to see if I have made a complete referencing guild  

##More programming practice
###Identify
Throughout the semester, my programming practice has been restricted to only working on course assignments. While this is a good foundation for work, I should be aiming to be working on code outside of this requirement. During the Summer holidays, there won't be any assignments and I should be prepared to work independently with my own set projects.

###Application, how they affected quality of submission, and why they became challenges
By working on my own projects, I would incorporate regular programming practice into my current workflow, which should improve my programming confidence. I have found that when I haven't had a programming project, my programming practice has stopped which later affected my quality of work where I was required to get back into programming again. This meant that the inital programming productivity was low during programming projects. This became a challenge as I didn't set myself any programming projects between course projects and failed to maintain a regular programming practice.

###To improve
To improve, I want to have a project over the Summer holidays, and future programming gaps, to work on to maintain programming practice. This should improve my confidence with coding but also my workflow by making time for regular programming practice.  

S - Have a Summer project proposal    
M - Have a Summer project proposal  
A - This is a reasonal aim and shouldn't take much time  
R - This is relevant to professional practice  
T - Next month, I should check to see if I proposed a Summer project
