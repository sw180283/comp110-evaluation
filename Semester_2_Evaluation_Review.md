(b) Write a draft 500-word report that must:
i. identify three key skills that you consider weaknesses;
ii. assess your application of each of these skills, describing how they
affected the quality of your submissions and suggesting why they
became challenges;
iii. and then identify how to improve each of these skills, with reference
to SMART actions.

The three weakness that I found I could improve, during this semester was: more regular github commits, better use of referencing academic papers and more regular programming practise.

##Regular github commits
###Identify
During my projects, I have found that my Github commits are unevenly distributed with a few days on several commits each, then no commits for a week.

###Application, how they affected quality of submission, and why they became challenges
When working in a software career, it is crucial to regularly commit work to a group accessable project so that the team can all follow the development of the project and also offer support and suggestions for improvement.
Also, this is needed for the individual to make sure that they are confident with their own work and not leaving gap during commits. It is suggestive that by not commiting Github regular that the code isn't being worked on. In my case this was true, in that I only worked on my programming in long bulk sessions isn't of regularly over a week in short sessions.  
This doesn't work for good programming practice and means that the workflow is poor and reducing my progessional practice mark.  
Another reason why this doesn't work for good practice is that by working long hours on one task can make the programmer lose focus and make mistakes. Instead I should have use short sessions to improve concentration and therefore produce higher quality code. I found that when I worked in shorter sessions, I figured our errors from the session before, the next day.  
Therefore, by sitting and working continuously didn't solve the issues.  

###To improve
To improve this skill I should time table regular expected days for commits and should schedule my programming sessions around this.  
If I expect myself to commit at least twice a week, then I should at least work on that project for two programming sessions. In addition, this will make sure that I have to go back to issues to see if they can be fixed on another day or take a break.

S - Make a schedule for expected Github commits each week  
M - Set 2 schedule deadlines for submitting code per week  
A - This is a reasonal amount of work when working around other assignments  
R - This is relevant to academic practice but also industry practice  
T - Each week I should see if I meet the deadlines for each commit  

##Better referencing of academic papers

##More programming practice
